Hey There! This is the portflio website in the skin of a terminal. I always wanted to be a hacker but recenty I have realised that im better off learning UNIX in order to do that.<!-- laglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglag --><p>Opening Varad Katkalambekar's Resume....</p>
<p>Hi, I am Varad Katkalambekar. I am an Engineering student studying in his penultimate year with field of study being Electronics and Telecommunication. Let me be honest with you, I love computer science. Yes you read it right I cheated on my branch! Take a moment to digest that....<br> So what do I do? <br> Right now, I am the CTO at UPYO Technologies, a company in its nascent stage right now trying to make an impact in the esports industry. Along with that I am studying Computer Vision, Machine learning and the best subject i have seen till date, Signal Processing.

<p> I have never been interested in doing things for an end result, I love creating things from scratch. I enjoy the Process. I was selected for the National Defence Academy's 144th course in 2020, but couldnt make it due to being medically unfit for Air Force and low on Merit in the Army List:( . After that I moved on to see and explore my self as an individual working at various startups in the fields of corporate law, edutech and left them with a month cause I didnt feel it was contributing to a greater cause. I started my own Company in 2021, yet to launch our product in the market, we have focused on Market Reseach and I am the lead Person behind our Technologies.
