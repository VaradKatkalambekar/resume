Hey There! This is the portflio website in the skin of a terminal. I always wanted to be a hacker but recenty I have realised that im better off learning UNIX in order to do that.<!-- laglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglag --><p>Opening Varad Katkalambekar's Resume....</p>
<p>Hi, I am Varad Katkalambekar. I am an Engineering student studying in his penultimate year with field of study being Electronics and Telecommunication. Let me be honest with you, I love computer science. Yes you read it right I cheated on my branch! Take a moment to digest that....<br> So what do I do? <br> Right now, I am the lead designer and developer at UPYO Technologies, a company in its nascent stage right now trying to make an impact in the esports industry. Along with that I am studying Computer Vision, Machine learning and the best subject i have seen till date, Signal Processing.

<p> I have never been interested in doing things for an end result, I love creating things from scratch. I enjoy the Process. I have always lead project groups since my school days. I was selected for the National Defence Academy's 144th course in 2020, I lost 18kgs of my body fat, but couldnt make it due to my eye being medically unfit for Air Force and low on Merit in the Army List:( . After that I moved on to see and explore my self as an individual working at various startups in the fields of corporate law, edutech and left them with a month cause I didnt feel it was contributing to a greater cause. I started my own Company in 2021, yet to launch our product in the market, we have focused on Market Reseach and I am the lead Person behind our Technologies. Right now, after our first beta test we understood about a few mistakes we made, so I am stuyding the tech industry for a deeper understanding of Product and Customer interaction.
